### I'm a Full Stack developer working remote in a small town. My favorite niche is Front End responsive web apps with Vue and occasionally React. I help clients with app development and design, spreadsheets, analytics, scripting, testing, framework integration, and general software solutions. I also create written content, graphics, music, and video.

### I have created various full stack applications and tools in several languages using various frameworks, libraries, and platforms, and provide troubleshooting, data visualization, and custom code solutions. I love to constantly learn and grow and change, which is a must, as <span style="background-color: black;">the state of software has gone from "everything is moving to the cloud" to "everything is being done by AI"</span> over the course of my journey.

## Work

#### I spent most of my young life as a metamodern transcendental meditator with an ironically useless Economics degree, performing and recording with bad rock bands, making bad comedy films and youtube videos, and writing bad science fiction stories, working every odd job imaginable, supporting the growth of artistic community in Western Pacific cities and towns, and eventually teaching music lessons.

#### In 2018, I arrived at the conclusion that the planet Earth had unwittingly transformed from predominantly human to predominantly software -- I needed in on that action! I rented a small apartment in Seattle and spent a whole Summer self-training around the clock in computer science and coding.

#### Having acquired these skills, I then had to pay off my self-training foray with a full time factory job. At this job, I moved over the course of a few months from a floor production position to devising and managing the company's product design, printing, and labeling solution. Only months later, after impressing management with advanced skills using Google Sheets formulas, pivot tables, Apps Scripts, Google APIs for automating data procedures between Google Cloud and MS Office 365 platforms, I fell under an excellent mentor, the company's Special Projects Manager, and acquired the exclusive role of Data Validation and Reporting, helping to create and design an AWS Php/MySQL server as the company grew from a startup to 400 employees. 

#### I took on primary UI and design for the company's analytics and custom software tools used by all departments, was instrumental in implementing SAP Business One ERP system, and provided weekly Power BI KPI reporting to top-level executives. I was responsible for refining data input and recording methods, auditing data and verifying figures, ensuring compliance with state and federal regulations, and played an integral role in interdepartmental communication and IT troubleshooting in a complex and fast paced environment.

## Current

#### Most of my work has been under NDAs or not public in nature, so unfortunately, what I can share on github are mostly cute personal projects that I was just doing for fun in the rare case that I finished things like that. Reach out if you're looking for a fun, flexible, and well-rounded addition to your dev team.
