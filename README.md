## What I Do

## Background

I started my career as a creative ‚Äî performing, teaching, and producing music and video ‚Äî before transitioning into software and analytics. Over several years, I‚Äôve moved from self-taught coder to key team member supporting high-growth startups, helping implement ERP systems, cloud integrations, and data systems used by hundreds of employees.

My foundation in economics gives me a sharp analytical mindset, while my background in arts and yogas makes me adaptable, collaborative, and eager to learn.
