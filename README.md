## What I Do

With a background bridging music, art, and tech, I’ve evolved into a problem-solver who thrives on making messy data useful. I’ve worked across industries, handling:

- Automating PDF → CSV extraction for bulk certificate processing  
- Building Python tools for scraping, parsing, and transforming data  
- Designing Power BI dashboards for executive KPIs  
- Connecting cloud platforms like Google Cloud + MS365 with Python scripts and APIs  
- Supporting cross-team data validation, reporting, and compliance

## Background

I started my career as a creative — performing, teaching, and producing music and video — before transitioning into software and analytics. Over several years, I’ve moved from self-taught coder to key team member supporting high-growth startups, helping implement ERP systems, cloud integrations, and data systems used by hundreds of employees.

My foundation in economics gives me a sharp analytical mindset, while my background in arts and yogas makes me adaptable, collaborative, and eager to learn.
