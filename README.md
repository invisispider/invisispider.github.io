### I'm a Full Stack developer working remote in a small town. My favorite niche is Front End responsive web apps with Vue and occasionally React. I help clients with app development and design, spreadsheets, analytics, scripting, testing, framework integration, and general software solutions. I also create written content, graphics, music, and video.

### I have created various full stack applications and tools in several languages using various frameworks, libraries, and platforms, and provide troubleshooting, data visualization, and custom code solutions. I love to constantly learn and grow and change, which is a must, as <span style="background-color: black;">the state of software has gone from "everything is moving to the cloud" to "everything is being done by AI"</span> over the course of my journey.

## Work History

#### I spent most of my young life as a metamodern transcendentalist with an ironically useless Economics degree, performing and recording with bad rock bands, making bad comedy films and youtube videos, and writing bad science fiction stories, working every odd job imaginable, supporting the growth of artistic community in Western Pacific cities and towns, and eventually teaching music lessons.

#### Five years ago (from 2023), I came to the conclusion that the planet Earth had transformed from being predominantly human to predominantly software, and I wanted to be a part of that action. I rented a small apartment in Seattle and spent a whole Summer self-training around the clock in computer science and coding.

#### Having acquired these skills, I then had to pay off my self-training foray with a full time factory job. At this job, I moved over the course of a few months from a floor production position to devising and managing the company's primary product labeling solution. Only months later, after impressing management with advanced skills using Google Sheets formulas, pivot tables, Apps Scripts, Google APIs for automating data procedures between Google Cloud and MS Office 365 platforms, I fell under an excellent mentor, the company's Special Projects Manager, and acquired the exclusive role of Data Validation and Reporting, helping to create and design an AWS Php/MySQL server as the company grew from 30 to 300 employees. 

#### I took on primary UI and design for the company's analytics and custom software tools used by all departments, was instrumental in implementing SAP Business One ERP system, and provided weekly Power BI KPI reporting to top-level executives. I was responsible for refining data input and recording methods, auditing data and verifying figures, ensuring compliance with state and federal regulations, and played a primary role in interdepartmental communication and IT troubleshooting in a complex and fast paced environment.

## Current

#### I resigned from that position due to necessary relocation and lifestyle changes, as I was starting a family of backwoods spiritualists, and I have been freelancing on Upwork and for personal network contacts, in the time since. I am actively seeking remote work. Most of my work has been under NDAs, so unfortunately, the only things I am placing on my public github are personal projects that I was just doing for fun and learning that I actually more or less finished, or because I thought they were cute.
