# Namaste, friends. 

### I am a full-stack developer living in small-town Michigan. I help clients with web design, spreadsheets, web scrapes, and general software solutions. I have created web sites and landing pages for several professional clients, and provide troubleshooting, data analytics visualizations, and custom code solutions. I also write and edit professional written content and produce graphics, music, and video.

### Proficient in:
- Python. PHP. JavaScript. Some C++. Linux/Bash.
- Vue. React. Node. CSS. JQuery. UI Frameworks.
- Google APIs. Sheets. Docs. Apps Scripts. DataStudio. Firebase.
- MS Office 365. Teams. Power BI. Excel.

###### At my last job, I moved over the course of a few months from a floor position to devising and managing the company's primary product labeling solution. Only months later, after impressing management with advanced skills using Google Sheets formulas, pivot tables, Apps Scripts, and Google APIs for automating data procedures between the Google cloud and Microsoft Office 365 and Excel platforms, I gained the exclusive role of Data Validation and Reporting, helping to create and design a Php/MySQL server on AWS platform as the company grew from 30 to 300 employees. I took on primary UI and design for the company's analytics and custom software tools used by all departments, was instrumental in implementing SAP Business One and providing Power BI KPI reporting to top-level executives. I was responsible for refining data input and recording methods, auditing data and verifying figures, ensuring compliance with state and federal regulations, and played a primary role in interdepartmental communication and IT troubleshooting in a complex and fast paced environment.
